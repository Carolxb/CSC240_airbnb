Once you open our website, there appears to be a place where you can log in with your name, SSN, and birthday. If you are not a user, you need signup first in the lower part of this page and submit your information. Once you submit, it will tell you if you’ve successfully create this new account. If you succeed, you can then go back to the initial page to log in the system with your sign up information. If the information you input match to the information of your created account info, you can successfully log in and enter the system. Note that if you are not an existed user, or your information is not entered correctly, your information will be checked wrong and cannot go into the system. Plus, while logging in, if your SSN is not 9-digit long, you won’t be able to submit your information.
 
After logging in the system, you’ll see three main tabs on the main menu page. When you put your mouse on the tab without clicking and wait for a while, there will be a floating window appeared to introduce the function of the tab to you and what you need to prepare for using certain function. Go to “Check Library ID first”, you can see the information about library ID and the corresponding library name and address. Then, go to “Book Borrow and Return”. Click on “Book Search” first and enter the information about the book you want to borrow as well as the expected date you want to get the book. If the book information is NOT entered correctly or NOT within our book list, it will show “There's no matched book you search for. Please back to book search and reinput.”. Otherwise, you can see a drop-down menu with all corresponding books with unique book_ID, and other specific information of the book like book name, author, publish year, genre, and language. You can check the one you ensure you want on the drop-down menu and click “Go to see the available copies” tab below to see the available copies of the book on your expected borrow date. If all the book copies has been borrowed and none’s due_date is before the expected borrow date you input, it will show "Sorry, according to the expected borrow date you input, there's no corresponding copy available of the book you search for. Please check if it will available on other date." and you need to go back to the book search to reinput. Otherwise, it will show all the book copies available on the date you expected to borrow the book. They will be shown as a table with columns Book_ID, Copy_ID, Library_ID, Price, and Late return fine per day, so that you can get more specific information to see which available copies you can borrow. After you decide to borrow which one, you need to ensure you remember the Book_ID, Copy_ID, Library_ID since they’ll be used when you borrow the book copy. 

Then, you can “Go to borrow book” and enter that information as well as your SSN, the actual date(current_date) you borrow the copy, and the date you expect to return it(due_date). If the information of the copy you input are correct, the borrow date and due date you input are reasonable, and the copy hasn’t been borrowed or it has been returned, a new borrowing record will be created shown you’ve successfully borrowed this book copy and you’ll get a corresponding record ID which will be used when you return the book copy. If the copy at the date you want to borrow the book is not available or you input wrong information of the copy, you get a message showing “Sorry, you can't borrow this book since it's not available. Please check the information you input. If the info you input are corresponding to the copy result you search, it means the book copy hasn't been returned.” If the ssn you input is wrong, it will show you “Sorry, your ssn is not in our account list. Please try again.” If the borrow date and due date you input are not reasonable, for instance, if you input a borrow date after the due date, it’ll show you “The borrowed_date and due_date you input are not reasonable. Please back to borrow book and input again.”. If you are done, you could log out the library system. Or, repeat the process and borrow more books. If you want to return the book you borrowed before, go to “Return Book” and put down the record ID and the return date, then hit the Submit button. If the record ID you input is not on the borrow record table, it will show you “Your record ID does not exist. Please check and reinput.” If the return date you input is before the borrow date, it will show you “You input an unreasonable return date. Please reinput.” If you return the book before the due date, the system will show you that you return the book beforehand. If you return the book on the due date, the system will show that you return the book on time. If you don't return the book on the due date, the system will show that you returned the book late, and you will be charged a late fine according to the days you exceeded the expected return date. 

Also, to view the information table, click on “Resource View” on the main menu. “Check Borrowing Record Table” tab leads to the record table, “Check Book Table” tab leads to the book table, “Check Copies Table” tab leads to the book copy record table, and “Check User List” tab leads to the user account information table. 

If you want to log out the system, click on “Log out” to log out of the system. If you no longer want to be a user of this library system, click “Sign out” on the main menu page, and enter the user name and SSN correctly. User who doesn’t enter the information correctly or hasn’t returned the book he/she borrowed will not be allowed to sign out. When a user is signed out correctly, in other words, no longer a user of the library system, his/her borrow record will still be present in the borrowing record table, but his/her SSN will be set NULL, in order to avoid reference integrity violation.
